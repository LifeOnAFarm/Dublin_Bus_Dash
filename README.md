## Synopsis

This an simple application that uses a Amazon Dash button to reading out the due times of a dublin bus stop 

## Motivation

I made this project because I often find it a pain using the Dublin Bus app. This way I own need to press one simple button and the next bus time is read out to me. I also managed to get a Dash button and wanted to make some sort of projectt with it.
