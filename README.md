## Synopsis

This an simple application that uses a Amazon Dash button to reading out the due times of a dublin bus stop. Changes need to be made in the file to pick where bus stop you want read out. In a future update I'll add the choice of which bus is arriving at the bus stop.
This only works on windows computers and uses Python 3
## Motivation

I made this project because I often find it a pain using the Dublin Bus app. This way I own need to press one simple button and the next bus time is read out to me. I also managed to get a Dash button and wanted to make some sort of projectt with it.
