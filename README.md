## Synopsis

This is a simple application that uses a Amazon Dash button to read out the due times of a dublin bus stop. Changes need to be made in the file to pick which bus stop you want to read out and the Mac address of your dash button needs to be written into the code. In a future update I'll add the choice of which bus is arriving at the bus stop.
This only works on Windows computers and uses Python 3. If you want this to work on a Raspberry Pi check out this [link](https://github.com/LifeOnAFarm/Dublin_Dash_Pi)
## Motivation

I made this project because I often find it a pain using the Dublin Bus app. This way I omly need to press one simple button and the next bus time is read out to me. I also managed to get a Dash button and wanted to make some sort of project with it.
